DESCRIPTION
    google is a command-line interface to Google Search. It uses Aaron
    Straup Cope's Net::Google library, which in turn, is an interface to
    Google's SOAP API.

    To be able to use this tool, you first need to create an account with
    Google. It is free. Visit http://www.google.com/apis/ for details. After
    creating your account successfully, you will be provided with a key to
    use this tool.

INSTALLATION
      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

    The above set of commands will install the library to your sitebin
    folder. It is usually /usr/bin/ in some *nix machines. If you do not
    have write access to this folder, you can alternatively install in your
    own ~/bin directory:

      perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSCRIPT=~/bin
      make
      make install

USING google
    Every time you use google to search the Web, you should provide your key
    with "--key" option. I know, it gets pretty tedious in no time. That's
    why we added support for default options file.

    google searches for a file called .google or .googlerc in your home
    directory. If it can't find any, it looks for those files in your
    current directory as well as in the directory google was installed in.

      [google]
      key=yourLongKeyGoesHere

    You can find a more verbose option file in the google distribution
    folder. Options provided in the command line will override the ones set
    in the options file.

EXAMPLES
      google mod_perl

    returns first 10 (unless you overrode it in your options file) results
    for keyword "mod_perl".

      google --max-results=5 --snippet mod_perl

    similar to the first example, but returns first 5 results with snippets.

      google mod_perl site:apache.org

    returns first 10 results for mod_perl from apache.org

      google info:perl.com

    returns brief information about the resource

      google related:perl.com

    returns related resources for perl.com

      google link:cpan.org

    returns first 10 resources that have links to cpan.org.

TODO
    Support for Google's spell checker, as well as Google cache
